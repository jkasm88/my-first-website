# My very first Web Page

##Welcome!

This was a great lesson in using gitpod and github and how they work together. Being able to write code then display it for others to see, hopefully potential companies looking for software developers.
Learning to add files to the git staging area, committing, then pushing to github. The moving van analogy was very helpful.

##THANKS!
